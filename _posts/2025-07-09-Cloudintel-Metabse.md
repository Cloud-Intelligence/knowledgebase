To illustrate the power of analytics, we’ve developed a custom dashboard in Metabase using a fictitious pizza delivery dataset.

We found a [dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaygaikwad448/pizza-delivery-data-with-enhanced-features) that listed pizza orders and deliveries across the USA, with metrics of delivery times, order volumes, toppings coverage and geographic location we decided to make a dashboard diving into how franchises are performing and a view of the customer base.

Our goal was to extract actionable insights from the dataset the could be used by current pizza franchise owners and potential new franchisees, take a look at some of our highlighted visualisations below
