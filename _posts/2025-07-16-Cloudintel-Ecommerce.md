For CFOs and finance leaders, the biggest challenge isn’t a lack of data, it’s the struggle to bring together information scattered across endless spreadsheets and databases. Making strategic decisions with incomplete or fragmented data is like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces. How can you steer your company confidently when you never see the full financial picture?


At Cloud Intelligence, we understand this pain point. That’s why our data team has developed a new demo dashboard in Metabase, purpose-built to unify your most important financial data. Leveraging the Pispace demo dataset, we built a dashboard that consolidates two primary revenue streams. The Subscriptions and Retail Products into a single, reliable view. The result? Real-time, actionable insights that empower CFOs , Retail, and Subscription teams to make smarter, faster decisions.


## Why a Unified Financial View Matters

Siloed financial data isn’t just inconvenient; it’s risky. When information lives in separate systems, you face inaccurate forecasts, missed growth opportunities, and sluggish responses to market changes. Think of it this way: navigating market volatility with disconnected data is like flying a plane with separate instruments for each engine. You might see parts of the picture, but never the full story of your forward momentum.


That’s where the Cloud Intelligence data team comes in, leveraging the power of Metabase, where we have the ability not only to create stunning visuals that provide insights, but also to unify your dataset from fragmented sources and deliver meaningful insights. We work closely with your team leaders to break down data silos and integrate your most critical financial information into a single, unified dashboard. By combining our expertise in financial analytics with Metabase’s flexible, open-source platform, we deliver a custom “command centre” that provides the clarity and control you need to steer your company’s financial health with confidence.



## A Tale of Two Revenue Streams: Inside the Dashboard
#### The Retail Products View: Maximizing Retail Profitability


Retail product orders are often more volatile than subscriptions, but they offer significant opportunities for margin optimisation if you have the right insights. The Cloud Intelligence data team harnesses the full power of Metabase to transform your raw order data into actionable intelligence, enabling your finance team to make smarter, faster decisions.


To identify which products are most and least in demand, we use interactive stacked bar charts in Metabase. These charts display product orders over time, allowing you to spot trends, seasonal fluctuations, and shifts in customer preferences at a glance. By drilling down into specific product categories, your team can quickly determine which products are driving revenue and which may need re-evaluation or targeted promotion.

*A stacked bar chart shows how product demand varies across quarters.*

Heat maps highlight the regions generating the highest and lowest revenues, making it easy to identify underperforming areas and redirect marketing or inventory efforts where they will have the greatest impact.

#### The Subscription View: The Engine of Predictability
Understanding the effectiveness of your acquisition channels is crucial for optimizing marketing investments.

</div>

*Using Metabase’s Sankey charts, our dashboard visualizes the entire customer journey from initial contact through various acquisition channels to final subscription or checkout.*

Trial conversion rates are another key metric for subscription businesses. With Metabase’s trend cards, we display real-time conversion percentages, enabling you to monitor changes and quickly identify areas for improvement. This visualisation provides a snapshot of how effectively your trials are converting into paid subscriptions, supporting data-driven decisions to refine your onboarding and retention strategies.


By combining these powerful Metabase visualisations, the Cloud Intelligence data team unifies subscription and retail orders data into a single, cohesive dashboard, equipping CFOs, Retail and Subscription leaders with the insights needed to justify marketing spend, optimise acquisition strategies, and drive predictable revenue growth.

Metabase is a powerful, open-source analytics platform that enables rapid dashboard development and intuitive data exploration. Its flexibility in unifying different datasets and ease of use make it an ideal choice for organisations seeking to quickly turn complex data into actionable insights.


However, the true value of any BI tool lies in how it’s applied. At Cloud Intelligence, we bring deep expertise in data modelling and financial analytics to the table. When working with Pispace’s data, our team didn’t just build dashboards; we carefully structured and modelled the underlying data to separate it into two meaningful financial views: retail and subscriptions, and compared them. This thoughtful approach ensures that Pispace’s leadership isn’t just looking at numbers, but gaining clear, actionable perspectives tailored to their unique business model.


By combining Metabase’s technical strengths with Cloud Intelligence’s proven expertise, Pispace receives more than just charts and graphs; they gain reliable, decision-ready insights that drive confident, data-driven growth.


## Why Cloud Intelligence for Financial Analytics?

CFOs, Retail, and Subscription Leads share a core problem: critical answers sit in disconnected systems that never reconcile.Our Pispace demo shows how Cloud Intelligence fixes that at the data‑model level, not just with dashboards. The payoff: the CFO gets a defensible, single source of truth for revenue reporting for both subscriptions and retail.


We work stakeholder‑first capturing the CFO’s revenue forecast needs, the Retail Lead’s inventory‑versus‑demand pressures, and the Subscription Lead’s conversion and retention targets, then translate them into governed metrics and a unified data model surfaced through Metabase.
