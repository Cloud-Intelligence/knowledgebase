                    <p>First task I got given at this new internship was to learn git, and seeing as I never knew it, I am sure that there are many other people who never used git before as well, so I will put my study journey in here. I asked ChatGPT steps to learning git. So here is me learning git by following the steps and sharing my journey with you hoping it helps as well.</p>
